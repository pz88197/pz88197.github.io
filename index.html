<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS"><FONT COLOR="#D4E6F1">I'm 19 years old, and I was born and raised in China. Four years ago, I came to Georgia to study and started a new journey of my life.  At here, I met many people who have influence to me, such as my teachers, friends, and my dear host family. They taught me many lessons in life, and they always encourage me to achieve a higher level with love and support. I would not be able to become who I am today without those lovely people. </p>

<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS"><FONT COLOR="#F9E79F">As you can tell, I highlight two parts in my table, because these two words can tell you my personality straightforwardly. My favorite band is called BTS, which is a kpop boy band with seven members. They are so well known recently, not only because of their excellent music, powerful live performance, beautiful faces, but also their impacts on fans all around the world. Many fans like me declare that we find power and inspirations from their music. Their last album talks about an idea that in order to love others and the world, each individual should love themselves first. Every track in their album shares this beautiful message to the audience, and every words in their voice speak to my heart.

<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS"><FONT COLOR="#FCE3E2">Dancing is also something I have to mention because it has been playing a vital role in my life. When I was little, I was such a chubby girl that nobody except my parents believed I could dance well among all the other slim girls. However, as soon as I started dancing, I became the best dancer in people's eyes. Believe it or not, I got this talent inside of me. My mom always tells me that I look like an entirely different person when I dance; I am joyful and confident. Dancing sets me free from all the laughing I received for my short and fat body.
